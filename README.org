:END:

We'll need some level of abstraction to determine how much is destroyed. Burst
area greater than target area is destroyed, but how much under before we need a
second shot? And how do we add them up? Gets complex fast -- could just abstract
it to hit points.

Each thing takes one hit. For a larger target, they get split into a few smaller
ones.
