** Abstract from burst area / target area to hit points? (Scenario 1)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       efca6edb-b40f-45a3-af44-f188d1ebf1d0
:END:

We'll need some level of abstraction to determine how much is destroyed. Burst
area greater than target area is destroyed, but how much under before we need a
second shot? And how do we add them up? Gets complex fast -- could just abstract
it to hit points.
